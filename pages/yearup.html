<h1>Year Up</h1>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Year Up’s mission is to close the Opportunity Divide by providing urban young adults with the skills, experience, and support that will empower them to reach their potential through professional careers and higher education.<br>
<br>We achieve this mission through a high support, high expectation model that combines marketable job skills, stipends, internships and college credits. Our holistic approach focuses on students’ professional and personal development to place these young adults on a viable path to economic self-sufficiency.</p>

<h2>Year Up Bay Area</h2>
<p>Year Up Bay Area is a one-year, intensive training program that provides low-income young adults, ages 18-24, with a combination of hands-on skill development, college credits, and corporate internships. Since opening our doors in 2008, we have helped over 500 young adults cross the Opportunity Divide in the San Francisco Bay Area. 88% of our graduates are employed (earning competitive wages) or are attending college within four months of completing the program.</p>
