                <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
                <p>Software quality assurance (SQA) consists of a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality. The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may include ensuring conformance to one or more standards, such as ISO 9000 or a model such as CMMI.<br>
                <br>SQA encompasses the entire software development process, which includes processes such as requirements definition, software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, software configuration management, testing, release management, and product integration. SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, and verifications</p>

                <h2>Module Three QA</h2>
                <p>Students who are chosen to be in the QA track during module three are taught a lot of software testing skills. Topics are bug tracking, the types of bug testing, types of version control systems, and selenium base automation. Students learn the two types of manual or funcionality testing. One being Black-Box testing and the other being White-Box testing. They are also taught the difference between Static testing and Dynamic testing for bugs.</p>
                <h2>Software Tools</h2>
                <p>In module three, students are trained to use certain software tools. Some of these tools are Command Line, GitHub, JIRA, and programming languages. The main text book used in class is Software Testing by Ron Patton. This E-book covers the types of bugs, types of testing, the different approaches in software development, and more.</p>
                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>One of my favorite part about software testing and QA is the challenge. It is very fun yet very challenging to find and catch potential bugs. Reading requirements and seeing if the spec meets the requirements is fun. I really enjoy learning something that I will be able to use everyday.
